# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Neural Network

This repository contains a complete machine learning project that predicts the presence of heart disease using a Neural Network model trained on clinical parameters. The project also includes a Streamlit-based web app for real-time user interaction and prediction.

## 💡 Motivation

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction through intelligent systems can drastically improve patient outcomes. This project explores deep learning's capability to offer accurate, scalable, and real-time predictions for healthcare.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- Attributes: Age, Sex, Chest Pain, Resting BP, Cholesterol, Max HR, Fasting Sugar, etc.
- Target: 0 (No Disease) or 1 (Disease)
- Preprocessing: StandardScaler normalization, train-test split (80:20)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Type: Feedforward Neural Network (Sequential)
- Hidden Layers: 32 & 16 neurons (ReLU), Dropout 30%
- Output Layer: Sigmoid activation
- Optimizer: Adam | Loss: Binary Crossentropy

## 🌐 Web Application (Streamlit)

Users can input clinical data via a simple interface to get real-time heart disease predictions.

### Features:
- Sidebar form for clinical parameters
- Instant prediction output
- Probability risk score
- ROC/Accuracy visuals
- Clean UI/UX for clinicians & patients

## 🚀 Deployment

- Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)
- Can also be deployed via Heroku or locally using `streamlit run app.py`

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit

## 🔐 Future Enhancements

- Add patient data security & authentication
- XAI (Explainable AI) integration (e.g., SHAP)
- Support for ECG or image-based inputs
- Mobile-friendly version
